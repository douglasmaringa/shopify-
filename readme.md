To create a Shopify Partner account, create a Shopify store, and download the Shopify store theme code as a zip to your local machine, follow these steps:

1.Install Theme Kit on your machine by visiting https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/them....

2.Install Theme Kit access on your Shopify store.

3.When you download the theme access, install it, and then open it. It will prompt you to create a username and password. Use this password to link the liquid code to the store.

4.In the assets of this code, find a file named "apparel.csv." Download it and import it into the products of your store.

5.Add the products to a collection.

6.Open the terminal, navigate to the desktop by typing cd desktop.

7.Create a folder called "theme" on your desktop using the command mkdir theme.

8.Change into the theme folder you just created with the command cd theme.

9.Make the folders that constitute a Shopify theme using the following commands:

10.mkdir assets templates snippets sections locales config layout
Inside the layout folder, create a file named "theme.liquid." Inside this file, create "head" and "body" sections allowing the Shopify liquid code:

{{ content_for_header }}
{{ content_for_layout }}

11.Zip the theme folder. This zip file can now be uploaded to Shopify.

12.Upload the theme to Shopify, publish it, and then return to your code. Now, link your local theme to the one you uploaded.

13.Go to "Themes/Edit Code," and in the URL, you'll find the shop ID.

14.Open the terminal and type the following command:
theme configure -s shopifyname.myshopify.com -t shopId -p [password from theme access]

Press enter, and now your theme will have a config.yml.

15.To start the theme server for development, type the following command in the terminal:

theme watch --allow-live
Now, you can begin developing your Shopify theme.
